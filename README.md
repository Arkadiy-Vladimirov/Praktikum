# Algo Praktikum Repo
This repo contains my code for Yandex Praktikum Algorithms 2022-2023 course  

Regular tasks are often solved in a straightforward manner just to make the 
algorithm work. For more tidy and well structured code see finals in each 
sprint folder. Finals are two, usually challenging enough, problems the code 
for which is meant to be of good quality and has successfully passed code 
review.

All the problems are solved as .cpp code, hence to compile any you need to run 
in appropiate directory

    $ g++ filename.cpp -o filename -std=c++17

The course is completed, you may look at certificates `AlgoPracticum_ENG.pdf` 
or `AlgoPracticum_RUS.pdf` in this folder.
